        <p>Written on Friday, 23 Aug 2024, in my fifth fav cafe.</p>

        <p>Although the official GSoC coding period is over, Iâ€™m still working on my project to ensure that the project objectives are fully satisfied.</p>

        <p>The final report, posted on the SymPy wiki page, is available at 
            <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2024-Report-Hwayeon-Kang:-Implementing-Specific-Forces-and-Torques">GSoC 2024 Report Hwayeon Kang: Implementing Specific Forces and Torques</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Feedback from Mentors / Certificate</h3>
        <p>TBA</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>I learned a lot during the project and found multibody dynamics to be very interesting. It was a great fortune to meet my mentors as I entered the world of open source. This project wouldn't have been possible without their support. With more enthusiasm and passion for both SymPy and physics that I've developed during GSoC, I will continue contributing to SymPy after GSoC.</p>

        <p>I would like to thank Jason K. Moore 
            (<a href="https://github.com/moorepants">@moorepants</a>) for helping me establish the initial concepts of the models to implement as actuators, asking questions that led me consider important points I might have missed, and consistently reviewing my PRs and issues. Many thanks to Timo Stienstra 
            (<a href="https://github.com/tjstienstra">@tjstienstra</a>) for consistently reviewing my PRs and issues, helping me write more organised and clear code, and helping me set the concept of example models to add to the documentation.
        </p>

        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete the friction example model, a sliding block on a rotating disc, and merge PR 
                <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/26936">#26936</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Complete Hill's muscle model actuator and merge PR 
                <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/26443">#26443</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Add an example model of Hill's muscle model actuator to the documentation, starting with a single muscle.</li>
        </ul>
