        Although the official GSoC coding period is over, Iâ€™m still working on my project to ensure that the project objectives are fully satisfied.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I learned a lot during the project and found multibody dynamics to be very interesting. It was a great fortune to meet my mentors as I entered the world of open source. This project wouldn't have been possible without their support. With more enthusiasm and passion for both SymPy and physics that I've developed during GSoC, I will continue contributing to SymPy after GSoC.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to thank Jason K. Moore (<a href="https://github.com/moorepants">@moorepants</a>) for helping me establish the initial concepts of the models to implement as actuators, asking questions that led me consider important points I might have missed, and consistently reviewing my PRs and issues. Many thanks to Timo Stienstra (<a href="https://github.com/tjstienstra">@tjstienstra</a>) for consistently reviewing my PRs and issues, helping me write more organised and clear code, and helping me set the concept of example models to add to the documentation.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete the friction example model, a sliding block on a rotating disc, and merge PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/26936">#26936</a>.</li>
        <li>Complete Hill's muscle model actuator and merge PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/26443">#26443</a>.</li>
        <li>Add an example model of Hill's muscle model actuator to the documentation, starting with a single muscle.</li>
