        I've become a 2024/25 Year 3 Mathematical Physics Programme Representative! Being a rep and supporting the school has been
        one of my biggest goals in college, so I'm very grateful for this opportunity. <br/><br/><br/>

        My role is to represent fellow students in the third-year Mathematical Physics Programme.
        I'll be working closely with other student representatives and leaders, including members of academic societies,
        to ensure that any issues affecting students beyond our programme are effectively escalated and addressed.<br/><br/><br/>

        The School of Physics and Astronomy has an upcoming SSLC (Student Staff Liaison Committee) meeting, so my fellow Year 3
        physics reps and I are sending out online surveys to gather feedback on students' academic and social experiences this semester.

      <p>
        I also made an announcement at the beginning of the workshops to encourage students to complete the survey.

      <p>
        Since we’ve just set everything up and the timeframe is tight, we’re working at a fast pace. There have been some disagreements between
        reps and ongoing challenges with the process. We'll be meeting tomorrow to address these issues, review the survey results,
        and plan our next steps.
      </p>

        While working as a rep, I’ve found that my past work experiences have been very helpful. Although this role isn’t a scientific or technological one,
        it requires a lot of communication, teamwork, and decision-making skills. I often have to decide whether to move forward with the current
        ideas or wait for feedback from non-responsive peers, and then persuade them if they raise concerns after a decision has already been made.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, a few of my peers become quite emotional, as if they’re disagreeing with me personally rather than just my idea.
        I try not to focus too much on their emotions but instead concentrate on the ideas and evidence they present.
        During my gap year, I learned that there are many different types of people in the workplace, each with their own way of
        expressing and persuading their opinions.

      Lastly, I’d like to end this post with something my friend told me when I told her I became a rep:
      </p>

      <p><em><strong>
        With great power comes great responsibility!
